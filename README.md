# Penglab
Abuse of Google Colab for fun and profit. üêß

## What is it ?

**Penglab** is a ready-to-install setup on Google Colab for cracking hashes with an incredible power, really useful for CTFs. *(See benchmarks below.)*

It installs by default :
* Hashcat
* John
* Hydra
* SSH (with ngrok)

And now, it can also :
* Launch an integrated shell
* Download the wordlists Rockyou and HashesOrg2019 quickly !

You only need a Google Account to use Google Colab, and to use ngrok for SSH (optional).

## How to use it ?
1. Go on : https://colab.research.google.com/github/mxrch/penglab/blob/master/penglab.ipynb
2. Select "**Runtime**", "**Change runtime type**", and set "**Hardware accelerator**" to **GPU**.
3. Change the config by setting "**True**" at tools you want to install.
4. Select "**Runtime**" and "**Run all**" !

## What is Google Colab ?
Google Colab is a free cloud service, based on Jupyter Notebooks for machine-learning education and research. It provides a runtime fully configured for deep learning and free-of-charge access to a robust GPU.

## Warning
Google Colab prohibits the use of their services for certain [actions](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html#limitations-and-restrictions), including password cracking. By using **Penglab**, you risk getting your Google Colab blocked from accessing Colab runtimes (which is what makes this tool great). **Use at your own risks**.
